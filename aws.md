AWS is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It provides a server as s service.

it lets you run code without managing servers. you pay according to the time you used this service. it supports the code written in java, python, and node js. it is a serverless computing service provided by AWS.

Nuclio-

it is also a serverless platform built on top of Kubernetes means runs over Kubernetes and automates the development, operation and scaling of code. we can also run this on docker. it serves data faster, and it provides lots of functions which the developer needed.

Edge Locations
Get Data Fast or Upload Data Fast to AWS
An Edge Location is a datacenter owned by a trusted partner of AWS which has a direct connection to the AWS network.
These locations serve requests for CloudFront and Route 53. Requests going to either of these services will be routed to the nearest edge location automatically.
S3 Transfer Acceleration traffic and API Gateway endpoint traffic also use the AWS Edge Network.
This allows for low latency no matter where the end user is geographically located.

Availability ZOnES (AS)
An AZ is a datacenter owned and operated by AWS in which AWS services run
Each region has at least
AZs are represented by a Region Code, followed by a letter identifier eg. us-east-1a
Multi-AZ Distributing your instances across multiple AZS allows failover configuration for handling requests when one goes down.
< 10ms latency between AZS

Regions
A geographically distinct location which has multiple datacenters (AZS)
Every region is physically isolated from and independent of every other
region in terms of location, power, water supply
Each region has at least two AZS
AWS largest region is US-EAST
services almost always become available first in US-EAST
Not all services are available in all regions
US-EAST-1 is the region where you see all your billing information

69 AZs and 22 geograpgical location

cloudwatch - alarm -> billing - its in region us-east-1 - service
IAM - service

user groups

root user

password policy alreadt set

EC2 service -> to create server -> launch instance -> choose free
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name YourKeyPair

edit iam role

session manager service

AMI service- snapshot server - right click -> image -> create image

auto scaling group service-> swicth server in case of failure or demand change

loan balancers service -> app load balancer type - it has dns(domain) name
ELPs - elastic load balancer service -> handle traffic change reginions also - on instance we can handle that

always stop/terminate the service that you start

s3 - create bucket / storage here
aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name

cloudfront - used as cdn - used in combination with s3 - add static content here

RDS - database service -> new db - select database type -> postgresql

lambda service - function - generally for logging

aws marketplace service -

AWS Artifact vs AWS Inspector
AWS Artifact
Why should an enterprise trust AWS?
Generates a security report that's based on global compliance frameworks such as:
Service Organization Control (SOC)
Payment Card Industry (PCI)
AWS Inspector
How do we know this EC2 instance is Secure? Prove It?
Runs a script that analyzes your EC2 instance, then generates a PDF report telling you which security checks passed.
Audit tool for security of EC2 instances

SNS vs SES
They Both Send Emails
Simple Notifications Service
Practical and Internal
Send notifications to subscribers of topics via multiple protocol. eg, HTTP, Email, SQS, SMS
SNS is generally used for sending plain text emails which is triggered via other AWS Services. The best example of this is billing alarms.
Most exam questions are going to be talking about SNS because lots of services can trigger SNS for notifications.

Simple Email Service Professional, Marketing, Emails
A cloud based email service. eg. SendGrid
SES sends html emails, SNS cannot.
SES can receives inbound emails
SES can create Email Templates
Custom domain name email
Monitor your email reputation

SNS vs SQS
The Both Connect Apps via Messages
Simple Notifications Service
Pass Alongs Messages eg. PubSub
Send notifications to subscribers of topics via multiple protocol. eg, HTTP, Email, SQS, SMS
SNS is generally used for sending plain text emails which is triggered via other AWS Services. The best example of this is billing alarms.
Can retry sending in case of failure for HTTPS
Really good for webhooks, simple internal emails, triggering lambda functions

Simple Queue Service
Queue Up Messages, Guaranteed Delivery
Places messages into a queue. Applications pull queue using AWS SDK
Can retain a message for up to 14 days
Can send them in sequential order or in parallel Can ensure only one message is sent
Can ensure messages are delivered at least once
Really good for delayed tasks, queueing up emails

Cloud* Services
Similar names, completely different services.
CloudFormation - infrastructure as code, set up services via templating script eg. yml,json
CloudTrail - logs all api calls between aws services (who can we blame)
eg. aws s3api create-bucket--bucket my-bucket-ash-test-123
CloudFront - Content Distribution Network, It create a cached copy of your website and copies to servers located near people trying download website
CloudWatch - is a collection of multiple services
CloudWatch Logs - any custom log data, Memory Usage, Rails Logs, Nginx Logs
CloudWatch Metrics - metrics that are based off of logs eg. Memory Usage
CloudWatch Events - trigger an event based on a condition eg. ever hour take snapshot of server CloudWatch Alarms - triggers notifications based on metrics
CloudWatch Dashboard - create visualizations based on metrics
CloudSearch - search engine, you have an ecommerce website and you want to add a search bar
