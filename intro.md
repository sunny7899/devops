Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, (CI/CD) Tools

It is basically a collaboration tool that helps in the interaction between the development and operation teams to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way. DevOps stands for development and operation.

It helps to increase an organization's speed to deliver applications and services. So, it is a better way of communicating and collaborating on things. They Analyse the whole process of deployment when something bad happens. They help to increase the fast delivery of software.

DevOps is essentially about streamlining the development lifecycle to deliver products faster with better quality. It involves CI/CD, automation, cloud computing, and a lot more in order to bring cohesion and trust between developers and system admins.

DevOps = developers & testers + IT operations

Before DevOps people spend more time on testing, deploying and designing instead of building the project. Testing and deployment were isolated activities before the DevOps. It is important to automate all the testing processes and configure them to gain speed and agility. This process is known as DevOps automation.

A DevOps engineer will work with development team staff to tackle the coding and scripting needed to connect elements of code, like libraries or software development packages. DevOps is the most trending profession. QA team use tools like selenium, WonderProxy to know and fix bugs in the new piece of code.

In this, you can version everything so that the earlier version can be restored anytime. In this, you mostly work on terminal and Bash scripts.

It is used for large distributed applications such as e-commerce sites or applications hosted on the cloud.

It allows agile development teams to implement continuous integration and delivery.  

DevOps lifecycle-

Test- build- code- release-deploy-plan-monitor-operate

The challenge faced by large DevOps Teams that maintain large huge IT infrastructure can be classified briefly into six different categories:

1-Infrastructure automation-



2-Configuration management-

Chef: Tool for achieving speed, scale and consistency.

3-Deployment automation-

Jenkins-  Jenkins is one of the most popular DevOps tools that allow monitoring of the execution of repeated jobs. Apart from this, Jenkins lets us integrate the changes and access the results easily and quickly.

4- System Performance management-

App dynamic: Offers real-time performance monitoring to help the developer debug when an issue occurs.

5-Log management and analysis-

papertraill, ELK, Graylog, 

Splunk: analyze all logs in one place

6- process Monitoring and alerting-Continuous Monitoring

App dynamic, new relic, Pagerduty, Munin, graphite, Zabbix, Prometheus, compiling apps from source (GCC)

Nagios: when service goes down then it will notify to team and they can quickly correct this. This DevOps tool helps monitor the IT infrastructure. It is capable of determining errors and rectifying them with the help of the standard network, server, and log monitoring systems.

Several tools such as  Splunk, ELK Stack, and Sensu are used for monitoring the application. They help us monitor our applications and servers closely to check their health and whether they are operating actively. Any major issue detected by these tools is forwarded to the development team to fix in the continuous development phase.

Tools and technologies DevOps engineers must be aware of:

Automation-

CFEngine,

Packer,

PowerShell,

SAIL DevOps,

Puppet - It allows delivering and releasing technology changes quickly and frequently. It has features of versioning, automated testing, and continuous delivery.

Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, (CI/CD) Tools-

Jenkins(Jenkins is the tool that is used for continuous integration. Here, we can pull the latest code from the GIT repository, of which we can produce the build and deploy it on the test or the production server), cloud bees, Travis, Drone, Bamboo, GitHub actions, Ionic app flow, Microsoft app centre,  Gitlab CI, AWA code pipeline(physical or cloud machine), Travis CI, Azure DevOps, Circle Ci, Bitbucket pipeline,

buddy build- continuous integration and delivery software for Git developers that can be used to build, test and deploy

Containers- Docker(Docker is a high-end DevOps tool that allows building, shipping, and running distributed applications on multiple systems. It helps assemble the applications quickly and is typically suitable for container management), RKT(Rocket), LXC(Linux Containers)

cluster managers- mesosphere, Mesos, Docker swarm, Nomad, 

Kubernetes:   Use a K3s Kubernetes Cluster For Your GitLab Project, Create a k3s cluster and integrate it into your GitLab project 

ext editors-

Vim tool, eMACS

Network knowledge-

OSI model TCP/Ip/UDP Common ports TLS, STARTTLS, SSL, HTTPS, SCP, SSH, SFTP

knowledge about the different file systems.

Text manipulation

cloud9 ide -cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. full Ubuntu workspace in the cloud

PuTTY is an SSH and telnet client.

mobaxterm is like putty

IAM- Identity and Access Management

two types of accounts on google - user and service accounts:

It accepts requests from registered applications. request from anonymous apps is rejected.

Automated build and deployment process through Apache Maven(To build/package the code into an executable file, we can use a reliable tool, namely, Maven- CD), Apache Subversion, and Atlassian Bamboo CI solution.
