Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, (CI/CD) Tools

It is basically a collaboration tool that helps in the interaction between the development and operation teams to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way. DevOps stands for development and operation.

It helps to increase an organization's speed to deliver applications and services. So, it is a better way of communicating and collaborating on things. They Analyse the whole process of deployment when something bad happens. They help to increase the fast delivery of software.

DevOps is essentially about streamlining the development lifecycle to deliver products faster with better quality. It involves CI/CD, automation, cloud computing, and a lot more in order to bring cohesion and trust between developers and system admins.

DevOps = developers & testers + IT operations

Before DevOps people spend more time on testing, deploying and designing instead of building the project. Testing and deployment were isolated activities before the DevOps. It is important to automate all the testing processes and configure them to gain speed and agility. This process is known as DevOps automation.

A DevOps engineer will work with development team staff to tackle the coding and scripting needed to connect elements of code, like libraries or software development packages. DevOps is the most trending profession. QA team use tools like selenium, WonderProxy to know and fix bugs in the new piece of code.

In this, you can version everything so that the earlier version can be restored anytime. In this, you mostly work on terminal and Bash scripts.

It is used for large distributed applications such as e-commerce sites or applications hosted on the cloud.

It allows agile development teams to implement continuous integration and delivery.  

DevOps lifecycle-

Test- build- code- release-deploy-plan-monitor-operate

The challenge faced by large DevOps Teams that maintain large huge IT infrastructure can be classified briefly into six different categories:

1-Infrastructure automation-



2-Configuration management-

Chef: Tool for achieving speed, scale and consistency.

3-Deployment automation-

4- System Performance management-

App dynamic: Offers real-time performance monitoring to help the developer debug when an issue occurs.

5-Log management and analysis-

papertraill, ELK, Graylog, 

Splunk: analyze all logs in one place

6- process Monitoring and alerting-Continuous Monitoring

App dynamic, new relic, Pagerduty, Munin, graphite, Zabbix, Prometheus, compiling apps from source (GCC)

Nagios: when service goes down then it will notify to team and they can quickly correct this. This DevOps tool helps monitor the IT infrastructure. It is capable of determining errors and rectifying them with the help of the standard network, server, and log monitoring systems.

Several tools such as  Splunk, ELK Stack, and Sensu are used for monitoring the application. They help us monitor our applications and servers closely to check their health and whether they are operating actively. Any major issue detected by these tools is forwarded to the development team to fix in the continuous development phase.

Tools and technologies DevOps engineers must be aware of:

Automation-

CFEngine,

Packer,

PowerShell,

SAIL DevOps,

Puppet - It allows delivering and releasing technology changes quickly and frequently. It has features of versioning, automated testing, and continuous delivery.

Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, (CI/CD) Tools-

cloud bees, Travis, Drone, Bamboo, GitHub actions, Ionic app flow, Microsoft app centre,  Gitlab CI, AWA code pipeline(physical or cloud machine), Travis CI, Circle Ci, Bitbucket pipeline,

buddy build- continuous integration and delivery software for Git developers that can be used to build, test and deploy

Mobile DevOps automation, and mobile CI/CD

cluster managers- mesosphere, Mesos, Docker swarm, Nomad, 

ext editors-

Vim tool, eMACS

Network knowledge-

OSI model TCP/Ip/UDP Common ports TLS, STARTTLS, SSL, HTTPS, SCP, SSH, SFTP

knowledge about the different file systems.

It accepts requests from registered applications. request from anonymous apps is rejected.

Automated build and deployment process through Apache Maven(To build/package the code into an executable file, we can use a reliable tool, namely, Maven- CD), Apache Subversion, and Atlassian Bamboo CI solution.

IAC

  A company hosts everything in-house in an on-premise environment, while in a cloud environment, a third-party provider hosts all that for you. This allows companies to pay on an as-needed basis and effectively scale up or down depending on overall usage, user requirements, and the growth of the company.			
An on-premises data center is a group of servers you privately own and control.			
On-premises need a lot of space, power, and maintenance to store, while on the other hand, cloud solutions are offered by the provider.			
 On-premise software is installed on the computers and servers of the organization locally.
