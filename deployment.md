siteground-

domain and hosting for your site. As we know there are multiple companies which promise you to provide the best service. But I found these two that are really good at providing these services.  

Nowadays Security is the main concern of any website So Google made it compulsory for all websites to use an SSL certificate on any website. Your SEO traffic will go down if your website URL is not starting with HTTPS. Companies that am going to talk about also provide these services for free.

For server hosting, you can choose SiteGround or Bluehost.

In Siteground there are lots of plans available. For beginners, it is good to choose the GoGeek plan of hosting. SiteGround also gives you the option to Install WordPress with a single click.

You can also enable the HTTPS option by doing the following steps-

Go to CPanel -> check Security column -> click the Let's Encrypt button

After this, your site will more be secured.

For domains Go for Siteground or NameCheap.
